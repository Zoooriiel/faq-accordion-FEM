## What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?
I'm really proud of how the accordion functionality turned out. It's great to see everything working as expected. Next time, I'd like to experiment with using Bootstrap to make the layout more responsive and to simplify the styling process.

## What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?
The biggest challenge was with the JavaScript part, the accordion toggling. I was stuck on it for a whole day, but after a day, I finally managed to solve it. Additionally, I initially missed adding keyboard navigation, so I went back to revise the code and ensure it's fully accessible.

## What specific areas of your project would you like help with?
Iâ€™d appreciate help with improving my JavaScript, particularly in handling more complex interactions or making the code more efficient.
